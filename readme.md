Overview
This repository contains a collection of utilities designed to emulate the core ideas behind EaseUS Todo Backup. It centers on four key capabilities: system backup, incremental backup, disk cloning, and recovery. The tools are built to run on Windows environments with a focus on straightforward operation, clear feedback, and robust error handling. They aim to be approachable for beginners yet flexible enough for power users who want precise control over backup timing, data scope, and restoration order.

The project is organized around four pillars: reliability, speed, safety, and simplicity. Reliability means backups complete with integrity checks. Speed means the tools optimize typical I/O patterns to minimize downtime. Safety means the system prompts for confirmation on destructive actions and stores logs for auditing. Simplicity means commands and workflows feel familiar and predictable. The tools are designed to interoperate with common storage configurations, from local disks to network shares to external USB drives. They also provide clear status updates, progress indicators, and detailed error messages when something goes wrong.

The core ideas behind the tooling reflect a blend of practical backup discipline and a user-friendly interface. You can perform full backups, incremental updates, and selective restores. You can clone a system drive to another disk to prepare for hardware changes or to set up a new machine. You can recover data from backups confidently, choosing exact recovery points and destinations. This README describes how to use the tools, what to expect in typical scenarios, and how to adapt workflows to your environment.

Key features
- System backup: capture the current state of your OS partition with a complete or partial scope, ensuring you can restore to a known-good point.
- Incremental backups: record changes since the last backup, reducing storage use and speeding up routine protection.
- Disk cloning: duplicate a drive or partition onto another disk, preserving the layout and bootability in a straightforward process.
- Recovery workflows: restore from backups with point-in-time accuracy and minimal downtime.
- Scheduling and automation: set up regular backups and clones without manual intervention.
- Integrity checks: verify backups after creation to detect corruption early.
- Cloud-friendly options: optional storage targets or network shares to fit distributed environments.
- Diagnostics and logs: thorough logs for troubleshooting and auditing.
- Safe defaults: sensible defaults that work well out of the box, with explicit prompts for destructive actions.
- CLI-first approach: command-line controls that can be scripted and automated.
- Cross-version compatibility: designed to work with commonly used Windows versions and configurations.

How it works
The tooling set operates as a cohesive workflow around a few core modules:
- Snapshot engine: captures a snapshot of selected partitions or the entire system state.
- Data transfer module: uses efficient I/O paths to copy only changed data for incremental updates when available.
- Verification engine: computes and validates checksums to ensure data integrity after each operation.
- Recovery engine: reconstructs the system state or user-selected files from a backup artifact.
- Orchestration layer: coordinates backups, clones, and recoveries with clear progress reporting and error handling.
- Logging and auditing: records actions, outcomes, and system context to support compliance and troubleshooting.

Each module is designed to be resilient. If a step fails, the system reports the exact cause, preserves the last good state, and suggests next steps. The toolchain is modular, so it’s possible to extend features or adapt workflows as needs evolve. This design makes it practical to use in personal machines, lab environments, or small business setups where data protection matters but resources are modest.

Getting started
Before you begin, take a moment to consider your backup strategy. Decide what needs protection, how often you want to back up, where you will store backups, and how you will restore when needed. A clear plan reduces confusion during a crisis and helps you recover quickly.

Prerequisites
- A Windows environment with administrator privileges.
- Sufficient storage space for the backups you plan to create.
- A target drive or network location for storing backups. This can be a local disk, an external drive, or a network share.
- Basic familiarity with file paths and drive letters in Windows.

Download and installation
- The latest release is available from the Releases page. For the associated artifacts, download the Windows installer named easeus-todo-backup-tools_setup.exe from the Releases page, then run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts. The asset name may vary slightly between releases, but the installer is designed to present a straightforward installation flow. After installation, you can launch the tools from the Start menu or from the installed directory.
- You can verify the integrity of the downloaded file if you wish by using a checksum method provided in the release notes. This helps ensure you are using a genuine artifact and not a tampered file.

Usage guide
A typical backup session consists of preparing a target, selecting what to back up, and starting the operation. The same logic applies to incremental backups and clones. The user interface makes it easy to perform tasks with clicks, but the real power comes from the command line for automation and advanced scenarios.

Interacting via command line
- The CLI is designed to be clear and predictable. Here are representative commands you can adapt:
  - Back up a system: etb backup --system C: --target D:\Backups
  - Create an incremental backup: etb backup --incremental --system C: --target D:\Backups
  - Clone a drive: etb clone --source C: --dest E:
  - Restore from a backup: etb restore --backup D:\Backups\system-full-2025-08-12.etb --restore-point latest --destination C:\
  - List backups: etb list --target D:\Backups
  - Verify backup integrity: etb verify --backup D:\Backups\system-full-2025-08-12.etb
- The CLI supports common options for filtering, scheduling, and logging. You can script these commands and automate routine protection tasks.

Managing backup targets
- Local disks: Use internal SSDs or HDDs. Ensure the disk has sufficient free space for full backups and retention settings.
- External drives: USB drives or external SSDs are convenient for off-site protection. Make sure the drive remains connected during backups to avoid incomplete operations.
- Network shares: For small teams or multi-machine setups, you can point backups to a network share. Ensure the share has appropriate permissions and enough space.

Backup strategies
- Full backups: A complete snapshot of the selected partitions. These are larger but simpler to restore.
- Incremental backups: Store only the changes since the last backup. These save space and speed up routine protection.
- Hybrid approach: Run full backups weekly and incremental backups in between. This balances restore speed with storage efficiency.
- Retention policies: Define how many backups to keep. Automatic deletion of old backups helps manage storage.

Cloning and recovery
- Cloning creates an exact copy of a drive’s contents. It is useful when upgrading hardware, such as moving to a larger SSD, or setting up a new machine with the same OS and configuration.
- Recovery options let you restore either the whole system or individual files. You can restore to the original drive or a new location, depending on your needs.
- Recovery points: When restoring, you can choose from multiple restore points. This flexibility helps you recover to a moment just before a problem occurred.

Safety and data integrity
- Integrity checks ensure a backup is usable. After creation, the backup is verified with checksums and a consistency scan.
- Error handling: If a backup fails, the tool logs the error and suggests corrective actions. This helps you avoid silent failures that could leave you unprotected.
- Encryption and access control: When available, backup artifacts can be encrypted. Use strong passwords and keep them in a secure vault.

Workflows and examples
- Personal workstation workflow: Daily quick incremental backups to an external drive, weekly full backups to a NAS, and monthly off-site sync to cloud storage.
- Small office workflow: Central server hosts backups for multiple machines. Each machine runs scheduled backups at off-hours, with a centralized monitoring console to track results.
- Test and production separation: Use test machines to validate new backup configurations before deploying to production endpoints.

- Hardware: A modern hard disk or SSD with adequate free space for backups. For large backups, consider a drive with faster read/write performance to minimize downtime.
- Network considerations: If using a network share, ensure that the share is mounted and accessible before the backup starts. Network interruptions can cause incomplete backups.
- Permissions: Administrative access is typically required for full system backups and disk cloning to ensure you can access all protected areas of the OS.

Security and verification
- Checksums: Verify the integrity of backups and installers when possible. Comparing checksums helps ensure the artifact has not been altered in transit.
- Signature verification: If available, verify the digital signature of the installer to confirm the publisher’s identity.
- Access control: Store backups behind appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access. Retain backups as per your organization’s data protection policies.
- Data minimization: Only back up what you need. Use selective backup options to keep the backup scope tight and reduce risk.

Troubleshooting
- Installer fails to launch: Check that the downloaded file is complete and not corrupted. Re-download if necessary. Ensure you run the installer with administrator privileges.
- Backup stuck or slow: Verify that the target drive has sufficient free space and is not experiencing hardware issues. Look at the operation log to identify the bottleneck.
- Restore cannot find backups: Confirm the backup location and verify the path. If needed, use the list command to enumerate available backups on the target.
- Network shares not accessible: Check network credentials, permissions, and connectivity. Make sure the share is mounted before starting the backup.
